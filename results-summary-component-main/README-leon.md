## My process

I worked on the HTML elements first ensuring efficient class and id naming with CSS and JS in mind. I also ensured that I have all the base element then proceeded to styling them and finally adding functionality with JS.

### Built with

-JS custom properities
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned more efficient styling and most of all using JS to work with different components in the HTML, I  also learned about using CSS in JS but I didn't use it in this project.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue practicing the flex and grid property in CSS. I also want to write overall more efficient code
